# Rock-Paper-Scissors classification of hand signs using Tensorflow ✂️
<p> In this project, we will build a CNN model using Tensorflow to recognize Rock-Paper-Scissors signs (gestures) in a photo. The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the
palm facing downward; and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended. </p>
